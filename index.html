    <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalze"> I had visited in 2018</h5>

    <p class="text-muted text-left">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible.</p>

    <hr>

    <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize"> I had visited in Feb 2019</h5>

    <p class="text-muted text-left">It is a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Hiring a tour guide will be better to understand the stories of such a historical place. It is a beautifully maintained small complex with yellow painted walls. It is a historical site and famous among tourists. It contains a number of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical instruments built around 300 years ago.</p>

  <h5 class="text success text-left text capitalize"> I had visited in January 2020</h5>

  <p class="text-muted text-left">The Gateway is amongst the prime tourist attractions in Mumbai.[63] The Gateway is a protected monument in Maharashtra under the aegis of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).[64] It is a regular gathering place for locals, street vendors, and photographers.[33][14][K] In 2012, the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation moved the Elephanta Festival of Music and Dance from its original location at Elephanta Caves — where it had been celebrated for 23 years — to the Gateway, due to the increased capacity offered by the venue.[65] The Gateway can host 2,000 to 2,500 people, whereas Elephanta Caves could host only 700 to 800.[66]</p>

  <p>I watched it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the story, 
    or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron, Ant-Man and 
    the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel superhero movies. 
    You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite 
    impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi series. The movie shows how the Avengers assemble 
    once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe. The movie is lengthy, and it does run 
    for 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>
